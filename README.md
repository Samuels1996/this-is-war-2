# This-is-war-2
This is the sequel to the best game ever produced in project 2.

## Project Description

The four of us had decided that we wanted to set and create a sequal to the game that we had created during project 2. We set out to create this game utilizing React, GraphQL, as well as a few other technologies. You are able to create your account, login, and more! This game is still in development with updates to come in the future. 

## Usage

You may download the repository directly from GitHub and use npm i, npm run seed, as well as npm run develop. This app may also be used at the heroku link here: https://this-is-war-2.herokuapp.com/
